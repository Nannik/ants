     * 
     * The localToParent matrix is updated to account for two things:
     * 1. The geometry of the character's skeleton (bone lengths and directions). The character's
     *    skeleton does not change as it animates.  So, this part of the matrix will stay the
     *    same regardless of the current Pkose.  If ONLY this part of the matrix is applied, then
     *    the character will be in the default "T-pose" the mocap system uses to define the skeleton.
     * 2. The current Pose of the skeleton, which includes a joint angle rotation to apply to each
     *    bone.  Note that the joint rotations need to be applied in Joint Space and the transformation
     *    between each bone's Bone Space and Joint Space is a property of the skeleton.  Those
     *    transformations are already saved as member variables of this class.
     *  
     * @param pose Contains the joint rotation matrices for each bone needed to place the
     * AnimatedCharacter into a single pose (i.e., a single frame of motion capture data).
